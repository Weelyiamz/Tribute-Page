        <h2>Who is Nelson Mandela?</h2>
            <p style="color: #663300">Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African  activist and former president. 
            Nelson Mandela helped bring an end to apartheid and has been a global advocate for human rights.
            A member of the African National Congress party beginning in the 1940s, he was a leader of both peaceful
            protests and armed resistance against the white minorityâ€™s oppressive regime in a racially divided South Africa.
            His actions landed him in prison for nearly three decades and made him the face of the antiapartheid movement both within his country and internationally. 
            He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
            His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation.
            after retiring from politics in 1999, he remained a devoted champion for peace and social justice in his own nation and around the world until his death in 2013 at the age of 95.

        <h2>Top 3 Contributions of Nelson Mandela to Africa</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>He taught Africans what activism really is</li>
                    <p> With no fear in his heart, Mandela stood up to those who sought to oppress others. He was willing to give up his own life for the principles of democracy.
                        Speaking at his own defense case in Pretoria in 1964, he said:
                        I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.<br>
                        I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.<br>
                        It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.
                    </p>
                <li>Mandela effectively ended apartheid in South Africa</li>
                    <p>Through his incredible activism and unrelenting passion to end racial segregation in South Africa,
                       Mandela worked together with other activists to abolish apartheid, paving the way for true equality in his homeland,
                       and setting a better example of justice for the entire world as well.
                    </p>
                <li>He showed  everyone the incredible strength of the human spirit</li>
                    <p>By coming out of 27 years of incarceration stronger and more determined than ever to right the wrongs he witnessed,
                       Mandela showed nearly super-human emotional strength, inspiring all those who suffer from adversity.
